Project Structure

Here's how the project is organized:

my-project/
├── index.html         // Your main HTML file
├── style.css          // Your global CSS file
├── script.js          // Your global JavaScript file
└── server/
    ├── server.js      // The Node.js server application
    ├── package.json   // Manages server-side dependencies (e.g., Express)
    └── node_modules/  // Installed server dependencies

Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your server up and running:

    Navigate to the Server Directory
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change into the server directory:
    Bash

cd server

Initialize Node.js Project
Initialize a new Node.js project. This creates a package.json file to manage your server's dependencies.
Bash

npm init -y

Install Express.js
Install the Express.js framework, which makes it easy to create web servers in Node.js.
Bash

npm install express

Run the Server
Start your Node.js server.
Bash

node server.js

You should see a message in your terminal indicating that the server is running.
